# Style Guide
This is the style guide for this repository.

- Use the second voice plural (“you”).
- Capitalize every word of titles except for conjunctions, articles, two-letter prepositions, and the word “for” (mnemonic: “CAP4”). Examples:
  - “Asymptotic Notation” (rather than “Asymptotic notation”)
  - ”Getters and Setters” (rather than “Getters and setters or “Getters And Setter”)
- Code snippets
  - Follow [Python's style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/]).
  - Use single quotes (') as a delimiter for strings by default.
