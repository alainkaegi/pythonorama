# Style Guide
This is the style guide for this repository.

- Use the second voice plural (“you”).
- Capitalize every word of titles except for conjunctions, articles, two-letter prepositions, and the word “for” (mnemonic: “CAP4”). Examples:
  - “Asymptotic Notation” (rather than “Asymptotic notation”)
  - ”Getters and Setters” (rather than “Getters and setters or “Getters And Setter”)
- Backtick Python expressions embedded in the text. Example:
  - The Python expression `(2 + 3) * 4` evaluates to *20*
- Code snippets
  - Follow [Python's style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/]). In particular:
    - Use 4 spaces per indentation level
  - Use single quotes (') as a delimiter for strings by default.
  - Backtick text-embedded names referring to symbols (e.g., class, variable, and function names) appearing in code snippets. Example:
    - The variable `bar` defined in the class `Foo` is really wonderful
  - Omit the parentheses when referring to a function. Example
    - The function `baz` is very useful
