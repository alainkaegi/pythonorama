# Pythonorama
This repository holds topic summaries and questions for some of Lewis \& Clark introductory computer science courses based on the Python programming language.

The content and organization of this site owes to Peter Drake's [Drakepedia](https://github.com/PeterDrake/drakepedia/).

We have three purposes in creating this repository:
1. To keep our own notes and useful links organized.
1. To provide a place where we can direct students' frequently-asked questions.
1. To provide a bank of questions and answers, which both serves as a study guide and makes exam creation easier. Answers are provided, but there should be so many questions that memorizing all of the answers is infeasible.

We list additional online and print resources where applicable, trying to list the most valuable ones first. In general, print resources go into more depth or provide a more gentle explanation.

Questions are rated according to their difficulty:
- :star: By the end of the course in question, you should be able to answer these questions immediately off the top of your head. They often involve terminology or basic concepts.
- :star::star: These questions may take a bit of thought, close reading, experimentation, or research.
- :star::star::star: These questions require even more thought.

The table below shows which topics I expect people to learn in which courses. (CS1 is taught in C, but for these topics C and Python are sufficiently similar.) Links are to existing pages in the Drakepedia.
