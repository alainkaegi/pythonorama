# Sets
## Overview
Python can represent a set as you might have encountered in a math class:
```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
```
Like a list, a set is a collection of items, but it differs in a few ways:
* The order of the items in a set doesn't matter, so `{1, 2, 3}` and `{1, 3, 2}` are equal. An item is either contained in a set or not.
* A set cannot contain multiple copies of the same item.
* Syntatically, a set uses curly braces (`{}`) rather than square brackets (`[]`).
