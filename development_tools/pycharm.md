# PyCharm

## Overview
PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming in Python. It is "integrated" in that it brings together the editor, interpreter, debugger, and other features.

PyCharm is made by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). They also make [IDEs for a number of other languages](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/), including C, C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. A popular alternative is Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Setup
### Downloading
PyCharm is already installed on the machine in the CS computer labs, so you won't need to do this if you're working there.

You can download the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Community Edition for free.

You should also make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.

### Creating a Project
Everything you do in PyCharm takes place within a project. You'll typically have one project for each of your courses.

When you open PyCharm, it will either open your most recent project or (if there is none) take you to the Welcome to Python window. If you close any project(s) you have open, it should take you back to Welcome to Python.

From there, click on New Project to create a project. Choose the name of your project (something like `algo`) and decide in which directory you'd like to store the project (typically `PycharmProjects` within your home directory). Make sure the Pytheon version is set. If you check the "Create a welcome script" box, you'll get a simple program right away.

### Running a Program
You can run the `main.py` program in any of several ways, including:
- Right-clicking on the name of the program in the Project pane on the left and choosing `Run 'main'`.
- Right-clicking within the text of the program and choosing `Run 'main'`.
- Pressing `Control + r`.
- Pressing the green "play" triangle at the upper right or in the Run pane at the lower left.

Note that the last two options run the *most recent* program you've run, which might not be the one you're currently looking at.

### Creating a Program
To create a program, right-click on the name of the project and choose `New` > `Python File`. Give the file a name; PyCharm will add the `.py` suffix for you.

Here's a very simple program to type in:

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
