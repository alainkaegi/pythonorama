# `pytest`
## Overview
`pytest` is a [unit testing framework](../software_development/testing.md). `pytest` requires Python version 3.7 or better.

## Setup
To install `pytest`, run the following command:
```
pip install -U pytest
```

Note: You may need to use the command `pip3`, if Python 2 is still available on your system.

To verify that `pytest` has been installed, run the following command:
```
pytest --version
```

## Usage
Simply type:
```
pytest
```
and `pytest` will run all tests available in the current directory (see [testing](../software_development/testing.md) for more information on how `pytest` finds these unit tests).
