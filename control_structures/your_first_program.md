# Your First Program
## Overview
A simple Python program is structured like this:
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
Any number of statements can replace the line:
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```

### Expressions and Statements
An *expression* has a value: `2 + 2`. Expressions can be made up of other expressions: `5 + (8 - 4)`.

A *statement* does something: `print('Hello, world!')`. Statements often contain expressions, such as `"Hello, world!"` within the previous statement. Complex statements, such as [loops](loops.md), can contain other statements.

Some things, such as assignment statements and some [function calls](functional_decomposition.md#calling-functions), are *both* expressions and statements, because they have values *and* do things.
